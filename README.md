# PN532 NFC library

This library is for the PN532 chip to use NFC technology.

This is a fork of the [PN532 library by Seeed-Studio](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/PN532).

It provides a small bit a configuration code and small changes to be able to use its components as libraries in [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
